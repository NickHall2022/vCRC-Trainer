                <h1>Welcome to vSweatbox!</h1>
                
                <p>If you are a new controller waiting for your C Ground training, this is your place to prepare for your first sweatbox sessions. 
                    This is a tool designed to help you gain familiarity with CRC and controlling outside of your time with mentors. 
                    Don't worry about messing anything up; this is a completely isolated virtual sweatbox just for you. It is a simplified recreation of both
                    CRC and vStrips in your browser, matching how you will use those systems as closely as possible. 
                </p>

                <h3>Before you begin:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go through the VATUSA Academy courses and complete your ARTCC onboarding</li>
                    <li>Pass your SOP and Clearance/Ground Exams</li>
                    <li>Make sure you've read through all applicable SOPs and charts &#x28;and have them handy!&#x29;</li>
                </ol>

                <hr></hr>

                <h3>Tips:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Even though the planes can't hear you, practice actually saying instructions out loud</li>
                    <li>Click the Help menu in the bottom right corner of the screen for controls and FAQs</li>
                    <li>Check the Mistake Tracker at the end of your session for personalized suggestions</li>
                    <li>Spend some time observing on the live network to see how our controllers work</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Difficulty:</h3>
                <p>This setting adjusts how many planes will try to talk to you. Don't panic! If you start to fall behind, the simulation will 
                    wait for you to catch up. Prioritize good habits and correctness over speed.</p>
